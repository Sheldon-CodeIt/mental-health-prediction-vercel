            <p>Mental health is a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being, and it affects how they think, feel, and act. It's important at every stage of life and helps people cope with stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Some early warning signs of mental health problems include mood swings, lack of care for personal appearance, increased use of alcohol or drugs, and thinking life is not worth living</p>
